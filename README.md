## Mods
- [Nevermore](https://github.com/nevermore3d/Nevermore_Micro)
    with Delta fans usermod

- [Vefach](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/KevinAkaSam/VEFACH)

- [Unklicky_Z](https://github.com/majarspeed/Unklicky)
    Also running Unklicky_Z because my pin kept falling out my z-endstop when printing sticky PETG
    
- [Klicky Probe](https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe) Fell back to Klicky after trying Unklicky for a while, find it easier and more reliable, but I'll keep following the mod and might give Unklicky another chance.

- ~~[Auto_z](https://github.com/protoloft/klipper_z_calibration)~~ currently running [KlickyProbeZoffset](https://github.com/T4KUUY4/Voron-Stuff/tree/main/KlickyProbeZoffset), because I had consistancy issues with "Auto Z", I'm working on it.
